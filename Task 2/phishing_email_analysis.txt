# Analyst: A
# Date: September 24, 2025

 Objective
To identify and document phishing indicators in a suspicious email sample, demonstrating awareness of common email-based attack tactics.

 Sample Summary
The email appears to be from a financial institution, urging the recipient to verify account details due to “unusual activity.” It includes a link labeled “Secure Verification Portal” and an attached `.zip` file named `AccountAlert.zip`.

## Indicators of Phishing

1. **Spoofed Sender Address**
   - Display name: “Bank Security Team”
   - Actual email: `support@secure-bank-alerts.com` (not matching the bank’s official domain)

2. **Suspicious Link**
   - Hover reveals: `http://verify-now.securebank-alerts.com/login`
   - Domain is not affiliated with the real bank; uses misleading subdomains

3. **Urgent Language**
   - Phrases like “Immediate action required” and “Your account will be suspended”
   - Designed to provoke panic and bypass rational scrutiny

4. **Attachment**
   - `AccountAlert.zip` contains a `.exe` file disguised as a PDF
   - Executable files in email attachments are a major red flag

5. **Header Discrepancies**
   - SPF check failed
   - Received-from IP does not match claimed sending domain
   - Analyzed using MXToolbox header analyzer

6. **Grammar and Formatting Issues**
   - Multiple typos: “verifiction,” “securty,” “recieve”
   - Inconsistent font sizes and alignment

## Conclusion
The email exhibits multiple hallmarks of phishing, including domain spoofing, urgency tactics, malicious attachments, and header anomalies. It is highly likely to be part of a credential harvesting or malware delivery campaign.

## User Awareness Panel
Users should:
- Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading unexpected attachments
- Verify sender domains before responding to urgent requests
- Report suspicious emails to IT or security teams immediately
