Risk Analysis Summary – Nmap Scan
Date: September 22, 2025

This file summarizes potential security risks identified from the Nmap scan of the local network (192.168.0.xxx/24),one device was hidden from this report.

Device A (TP-Link Limited)
MAC Address: [hidden]
Open Ports:
- 21/tcp – FTP: High risk. Transmits credentials in plaintext. Recommended to disable or replace with SFTP

- 23/tcp – Telnet: High risk. Unencrypted remote login. Strongly advised to replace with SSH

- 80/tcp – HTTP: Medium risk. Web traffic is unencrypted. Suggest upgrading to HTTPS

- 139/tcp – NetBIOS-SSN: Medium risk. May expose internal shares. Restrict or disable if unused

- 445/tcp – Microsoft-DS (SMB): High risk. Common target for ransomware. Patch or disable if unnecessary

- 1900/tcp – UPnP: Medium risk. Can expose internal services. Disable on router unless explicitly required

Device B (AzureWave Technology)
MAC Address: [hidden]
Open Ports:
 No open ports detected. All 1000 scanned ports were filtered (no response). Device may be protected by a firewall or operating in stealth mode.

Device C
MAC Address: [hidden]
Open Ports:
 No open ports detected. All scanned ports were closed (reset), No immediate risks identified.

Conclusion:
This scan revealed several open ports in different devices in my network range and I have gone through the potential risks of these open ports.


Services on the ports:

Device A (TP-Link Limited)
MAC Address: [hidden]
Open Ports:
~21/tcp – FTP  
   Function:Transfers files between devices.  
   High risk: Sends credentials in plaintext.  
   Recommendation: Disable or replace with SFTP.

~23/tcp – Telnet  
   Function:Remote login protocol.  
   High risk: Unencrypted and deprecated.  
   Recommendation: Replace with SSH.

~80/tcp – HTTP  
   Function:Hosts web pages and admin panels.  
   Medium risk: Unencrypted traffic.  
   Recommendation: Upgrade to HTTPS and patch web server.

~139/tcp – NetBIOS-SSN  
   Function: Windows file/printer sharing.  
   Medium risk: May expose internal shares.  
   Recommendation: Restrict or disable if unused.

~445/tcp – Microsoft-DS (SMB)  
   Function: File sharing over TCP.  
   High risk: Targeted by ransomware (e.g., WannaCry).  
   Recommendation: Patch regularly or disable.

~1900/tcp – UPnP  
   Function: Auto-discovery protocol for devices.  
   Medium risk: Can expose internal services if misconfigured.  
   Recommendation: Disable on router unless explicitly required.
